# Ping-Pong-Web-App
A game similar to "Pong" hosted on a web page (https://people.rit.edu/nvm7252/235/project3/ as of the date of this commit).

HTML and CSS are used to create, structure and style the web page.

JavaScript and the PIXI.JS framework are used to create the game.

This was a project done for IGME 235 at RIT, and took a week to complete.
