    <header><h1>Ping Pong</h1></header>
    
    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>A classic game of hitting a ball back and forth. Get it past your opponent to score a point. Whoever scores the most points is the winner!</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>Action, Sports, Simulation.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop Only</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>"Ping Pong" is purely abstract. In the game, players are motivated to overcome their opponent in a battle of skill and coordination.
    </p>

    <h2>Esthetics</h2>
    <p>The graphics style is abstract, primitive shapes will be used to represent the ball and the paddles.</p>
    <p>The game's sounds will be 8-bit, reminiscent of an arcade environment. Sounds will play when a player scores, and when the ball makes contact with a paddle/wall.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>The player is only capable of moving their paddle vertically, not horizontally. When the ball comes in contact with a paddle or vertical screen bound, it will bounce accordingly.</p>
    <h3>Control</h3>
    <p>The player will control their paddle using the mouse. Their paddle will follow the player's mouse with some delay to make the experience more challenging.</p>
    <h3>Teaching the Game</h3>
    <p>The button the player will click to start the game will be off-center from the center of the game. When the gameplay scene is initialized, the paddle will be at the middle of the screen, and will move to the same y-level as the player mouse. This will make it immediately apparent that the player paddle follows the mouse. Additionally, the name "Ping Pong" suggests the goal of the player.</p>
    <h3>Player Learning</h3>
    <p>The player will need to learn that simply hitting the ball back towards the opponent is not enough to win. In order to score on the opponent, the player will have to hit the ball at a challenging angle for the opponent to reach.</p>
